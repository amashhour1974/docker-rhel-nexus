# [PROJECT MOVED] sonatype/docker-rhel-nexus

This project has been split into two and moved for better management and maintenance. 

## Docker Images

The RHEL and Red Hat CentOS images are now housed in our official Docker GitHub project, available at
[sonatype/docker-nexus3](https://github.com/sonatype/docker-nexus3). Information on how the RHEL and Red Hat CentOS
images differ from the default offering is described in [Red Hat Certified Image](https://github.com/sonatype/docker-nexus3#red-hat-certified-image).

## OpenShift Templates

The OpenShift Templates have been moved to a dedicated GitHub repository for deployment reference
architecture, available at 
[sonatype-nexus-community/deployment-reference-architecture](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/deployment-reference-architecture/tree/master/OpenShift).

## Sunsetting

As the contents from this repository are now housed elsewhere, this repository is considered volatile and may be
removed at any time. It will be kept up temporarily to provide guidance to the new location(s) and any reference
required to sunsetted files. The old readme is available at [README.old.md](./README.old.md).
